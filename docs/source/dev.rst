How to Help
-----------

PyLCP and the LCP itself are under active development, and contributions are more than welcome!

#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a bug.
#. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/points/pylcp>`_ on GitHub and start making your
   changes to a new branch.
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed.
#. Send us a pull request.

We use the `coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ package to measure 
code coverage and `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to generate documentation. 
Make sure any pull requests that you submit include appropriate test coverage and
documentation updates.
